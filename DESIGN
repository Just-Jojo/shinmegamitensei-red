Mixture of Persona and Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne (feat. Dante from Devil May Cry)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This cog features themes from Persona 5 and Shin Megami Tensei 3: Nocturne (SMT3).


Combat
------

Party members are made up of the Player Character (PC) and the Demons they have recruited.
The combat uses SMT3's Press Turn system, meaning that there is a set amount of turns, increasing
and decreasing from weakness/crits, misses, and other utility moves.
There are no all-out-attacks

Story
-----

Currently, I do not have a story in mind. I will more than likely just have random fights,
increasing in difficulty when more experience is gained.

Demon Fusion and the Velvet Room
--------------------------------

As this is a fusion of Persona and SMT, demons are summoned and fused in the Velvet Room.
Igor and his attendant will help guide the player and fuse, itemize, and register their demons.
